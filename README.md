# 2.5d-platform-shooter
Alpha version of a game im creating for mobile android and IOS
As a player you are shooting waves of enemies with a variety weapons on different generated maps. 
So far the game includes: 
Map generator with obstacles using seeds or random. 
Player input controls for PC/Linux. 
The game uses Unitys navmesh pathfinding for Enemies. 
Currently Ive made simpel Unity 3d models for map, obstacles, weapons, player, enemies. 
Blender models will be added later. Simple particle effects are used

I made a WEB build so you can try the game at https://simmer.io/@klingen/demo-shooter-alpha-v1
